# XP Calculation

They are allocated on the basis of a simple formula: **`XP = (Effort) * (Importance)`**
Effort is determined by the amount of time you worked on a project. However, measuring only the number of hours you worked would incentivize doing busywork, which we donâ€™t want. For that reason, we multiply the amount of time you invested by an Importance Multiplier. The Importance multiplier is inherently subjective. Currently, it is determined by the FOSSCU Maintainers, though over time the community as a whole will be more involved. The multiplier is a number ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. A low multiplier is applied to projects that are useful but not ground-breaking, while a high multiplier is given for critical or impactful projects. The following factors may increase the XP multiplier score:

-   Project team's suggested XP multiplier (self-reported)
-   Impact of the project
-   Visibility of the project
-   Benefits to the community
-   Complexity of the project
-   Reach of the project
-   Reception of the project
-   Bringing in more talent to the community
-   Creating more business in the future for community members
-   Working on FOSSCU core projects
-   Working on FOSSCU Social media and similar tasks for the community
-   Contributing to Open Source projects with >30 stars

We're still developing clear standards for determining the XP Multiplier. Until then, here are example projects with associated multipliers: 

-   **1.0 multiplier** - a project that shipped, but was ephemeral and non-critical for the community.
-   **2.0 multiplier** - a great straightforward project that is likely to be lasting and draw attention to the community. May result in future project work for the community.
-   **2.5 multiplier** - a great complicated project that is likely to lead to other members contributing more (ex. implementing a new feature for the FOSSCU Platform).
-   **3.0 multiplier** - an essential project for the community that creates immediate benefits (ex. improving the FOSSCU documentation).
-   **4.0 multiplier** - a flagship project for the community that brings many long-term benefits to the community (ex. developing a new FOSSCU tool).

The XP leaderboard showcases the top contributors by skillset. Members with a lot of XP get asked to join high-priority and interesting projects. You can also use your XP in FOSSCU as a credential for working in the Open Source community more broadly.
