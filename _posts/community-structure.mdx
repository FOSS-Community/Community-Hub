## Introduction

Proposing a new structure for the community is needed. The new structure focuses on members who constantly contribute to the community and keeping the space 'Open to All' at the same time. Thus, everyone regardless of their college year get equal opportunities and perks they deserve.
This structure also ensures that members **giving back** to the community get rewarded for their work.

## The Need

Unlike competitive programming, the Open Source world respects everyone from all backgrounds. Folks need not to be a developer only to contribute to the community. We welcome all creatives and developers.
You can be one(or more) of these to contribute back:
- Developer
- Designer
- Writer
- Developer Relations and Growth
- Operations/Community Management
	or *Define your own role*.

To ensure that everyone gets equal opportunities and keep the motivation going through the community, it is required to divide the community into a well-defined structure. 


## The Structure

The community will be divided into three experience levels based on the contribution. Believing in "*With great power, comes great responsibilities*", we have defined responsibilities and perks for each tier. They are classified into:
- Learners (Level 1)
- Contributors (Level 2)
- Maintainers (Level 3)
