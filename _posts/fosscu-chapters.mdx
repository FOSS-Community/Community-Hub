## Chapter Types

From our perspective, a FOSSCU Chapter can be of three types:

    Type 1: Chapter that operates under a School

    Type 2: Chapter that operates under College/University

    Type 3: Chapter that operates independently

**Root Chapter** is the Chapter that is responsible for the formation of the new Chapter. FOSSCU is the Root Chapter for all the Chapters. Curtrently, FOSSCU is a Type 2 Chapter.

### Type 1
