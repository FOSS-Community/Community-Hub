## Introduction

A reputation system is a tool used to measure the level of trust and contribution that a community member has. It incentivizes good behavior and acts as a tool to weed out bad actors. A reputation system can help to ensure that community members are recognized for their contributions, and are given opportunities based on their abilities and work.

## The Need

The FOSS community values collaboration and contribution. A reputation system is needed to recognize those who contribute meaningfully to the community and help to maintain a positive environment for all members.

## The System

The reputation system is based on Score. Members will earn Score for contributions they make to the community, and will lose Score for negative behavior. Score is visible to all members and is an indicator of a member's contributions to the community.

### Score Calculation

The following activities can earn a member Score:

-   Solving issues on the FOSSCU GitHub repository: 10-50 Score per issue solved.
-   Creating a FOSS project under FOSSCU: 25-75 Score depending on the project.
-   Writing documentation for the FOSSCU projects: 10 Score per documentation page.
-   Hosting a workshop or giving a talk: 20 Score per event.
-   Contributing to FOSSCU's social media accounts: 5 Score per post.
-   Participating in FOSSCU events: 5 Score per event.

Members can also lose Score for negative behavior, such as:

-   Violating the community code of conduct: -50 Score.
-   Submitting low-quality work: -10 Score per instance.
-   Not showing up for a scheduled event: -5 Score per instance.

### Score Levels and Rewards

Score levels are used to recognize members who have contributed meaningfully to the community. The following levels and rewards are proposed:

-   **Learners**: 0-500 Score
-   **Contributors**: 500-1000 Score (For First Year students, the required score will be 350)
-   **Maintainers**: 1000+ Score
